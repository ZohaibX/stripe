First of all, go to the stripe.com dashboard and on the developers section
grab the secret and publisher key 
secret key will be used on server and publisher key will be used on client side 

on server -- app.js 
we just have  special route in here with some data, which could be changed 

on client -- App.js
we have a StripeCheckout component and one funtion -- makePayment -- attached to it
and we will send all the data through that function

Testing
when clicking on the payment button
add email there
and on payment section -- write 4242 4242 4242 4242
and 12/21 123 for other details     
and then submit and test should pass
